# Introduction

A security audit on the **Dojo Chip** ($dojo) token.

## Disclaimer

A smart contract security review can never verify the complete absence of vulnerabilities. This is a time, resource and expertise bound effort where we try to find as many vulnerabilities, inefficiencies, and implementation flaws as possible. Security cannot be 100% guaranteed after the review or even if the review will find any problems with your smart contracts. Subsequent security reviews, bug bounty programs and on-chain monitoring are strongly recommended.
